File layout for statified executable.

Program may run just fine without any shdrs, but
there are a couple of program (include gdb, objdump)
which not too like ELF files without sections. 
(At least RH9.0)

I want to make friend with them so I have add Shdrs.


Allocated and Non-Allocated sections.

From "ELF specification"
SHF_ALLOC
	The sections occupies memory during process executing. Some control
        sections do not reside in the memory image of an object file; this
        attribute is off for those sections.

I.e. allocated section should be part of the one of PT_LOAD
(the only parts of the file loaded into memory) and as part of
PT_LOAD segment it's already present in the statified executable.

Non-allocated sections (if any) are not part of any PT_LOAD segment
and they should be copied from original executable.
